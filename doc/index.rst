Tutorial
--------

Each chapter in the tutorial contains a few examples programs to illustrate the
features of a part of the MolMod library. After the examples, some problems are
given that can be solved with small Python programs that are loosely similar to
the examples.

All examples can be found in the examples directory in the source tree. The
example scripts contain comments to explain the individual steps. In the
tutorial text, some more background is provided.

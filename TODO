milestone 0.1.2
---------------

- try to find out again how the graph algorithms work.

  For those who don't know: This algorithm was written by Toon Verstraelen
  during a long-lasting but moslty painless otitis media. He was deaf for more
  than a week, so he had the time to think about an effecient algorithm that
  detects symmetries and subgraphs in a given graphs rather efficiently. Six
  months later, he suddenly finds him in a situation that he could actually use
  the thing, but he has forgotten how the algorithm worked. Despite his good
  intentions of documenting the code this time, it seems that some external
  help is needed to find back the principles on which the algo is based.
  
  Now the algorithm looks very ugly, but actually it's very elegant and an
  example of how to uses the generators concept in python to create algorithms
  that can deal with very complex problems.
  
- implement the list of symmetries in a Graph or MatchFilter as a set, instead
  of a dictionary
  
- SymmetricGraph.init_symmetries -> add_symmetry -> self.cycles is implemented
  more effeciently as a set instead of a list.
  
- remove all debug code from graphs.py

- write good tests for the MatchFilters

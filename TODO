milestone 0.1.1
---------------
  
- Extend the SymmetricGraph. Make it able to use (non) equality of nodes.
  Use this to describe lower symmetric graphs due to differing node properties.
  This is finally usefull to make a MatchFilter that doesn't return symmetric
  duplicates in terms symmetry of the match_conditions

- In MatchFilters: if node in blabla: blabla[node] ...
  
milestone 0.1.2
---------------

- try to find out again how the graph algorithms work.

  For those who don't know: This algorithm was written by Toon Verstraelen
  during a long-lasting but moslty painless otitis media. He was deaf for more
  than a week, so he had the time to think about an effecient algorithm that
  detects symmetries and subgraphs in a given graphs rather efficiently. Six
  months later, he suddenly finds him in a situation that he could actually use
  the thing, but he has forgotten how the algorithm worked. Despite his good
  intentions of documenting the code this time, it seems that some external
  help is needed to find back the principles on which the algo is based.
  
  Now the algorithm looks very ugly, but actually it's very elegant and an
  example of how to uses the generators concept in python to create algorithms
  that can deal with very complex problems.

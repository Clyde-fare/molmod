PyChem TODO
===========

milestone 0.1.1
---------------

- change the unit conversion library so that it uses the following naming
  conventions:
    * to_unit is a function that converts a value in internal units to a
      value in external units
    * unit is the value of one external unit in internal units
    * from_unit is a function that does the inverse of to_unit
  Internal units are the atomic units, external units can be anything else.

- double check all unit conversions

- add documentation strings to the current code

- move and cleanup the binning tools and topology tools from
  Zeobuilder into this directory.
  
- move the molecule and interface codes from FFAudit to this
  project.
  
- write test that check wether all the code works fine

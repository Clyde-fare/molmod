This is the chemical notebook adapted version of MolMod. For the official version of molmod please see https://github.com/molmod/molmod.

This version will not install to a local install directory but can install into anaconda using the recipe included. It appears to be currently incompatible with anaconda accelerate's mkl libraries.


Molmod is a python package that is used by Zeobuilder and Tracks. Zeobuilder is
a GUI toolkit for the interactive construction of complex molecular models. 
Tracks is a collection of molecular dynamics and monte carlo analysis scripts.
MolMod groups a series of modules that are usefull for analyzing molecular
modeling simulations, and for setting op complex input files. MolMod can also
be used as a library for batch work, independent of Zeobuilder or Tracks.
